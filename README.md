<h1>Black Sonata telegram bot</h1>
I've always liked to play board games, but the same can't be said about my friends.
When I discovered the 1-player board game Black Sonata, I was happy. I wanted to transfer it to my mobile phone so that it would always be at hand.
To do this, I decided to use the functionality of telegram bots.
<h2>Rules</h2>
The rules are the same as for the board game with one exception. Fog cards cannot be used as hints in this version of the game.
<h2>How to play</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Copy code to your local repo</li>
  <li>Add TOKEN of your own tg bot in the main.py file</li>
  <li>Run main.py file</li>
  <li>Start playing :)</li>
</ol>

<h2>ToDo</h2>
There are a lot of things that can be added to this game:
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Add hints and other features of the Fog cards</li>
  <li>Add a player leaderboard and the ability to compete with friends </li>
  <li>Implement saving of player game results</li>
  <li>Something that I surely have missed</li>
</ul>
